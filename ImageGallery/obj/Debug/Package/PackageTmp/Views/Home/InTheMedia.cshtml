        Dirk Rozich blurs the lines between fine art and illustration.</h4>

        By Nancy L. Nierman
    <p>
        In order for Dirk Rozich to stand out and be competitive in the art world, he needed
        to produce something permanent, yet fresh, something different from the norm. With
        Norman Rockwell as his artist hero, Rozich set off to capture the essence of an
        illustration icon. What he found was his artistic voice through narratives that
        integrate his fine art and illustration. Like Rockwell, Rozich is able to switch
        between the two. More recently he has eloquently combined the two in his mural paintings.
        "There is a very distinct line between fine art and illustration and I think I blur
        the lines sometimes. Illustrators depend on tradition. There is always a narrative
        background," he says.</p>
    <p>
        Rozich always wanted to be an artist. A precocious child, he started drawing at
        the age of 2 and even baffled his kindergarten teacher who said it was impossible
        for a child of 6 to have his ability. But that Christmas in 1986, he presented his
        mother with his first Santa drawing. In the 22 years since, he has produced over
        15 more Santas that he keeps hidden from her each year until Christmas Eve.

        At West Branch High School, Rozich majored in art. He credits two teachers with
        being essential in his pursuit as an artist: Susan Kahle, his elementary art teacher
        (now an administrator), and his retired high school art teacher, Carleen Prue. Both
        were mentors who have followed his successful career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rozich says he has been fortunate. During his college years at the Columbus College
        of Art and Design, he was the only senior from his school to exhibit in the student
        section of the Society of Illustrators Exhibition in New York. He had a chance to
        meet his heroes in the illustration world and they weren't too encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduation, Rozich headed to Chicago with the goal of becoming a top editorial
        illustrator. But his inspirations had been dulled by the negativism toward the profession.
        Those already in the business told him that the market was competitive and glutted
        with people coming out of school with high hopes of making it in the field of illustration.

    <p>
        Somewhat dejected, but not defeated, Rozich asked himself, "What can I do to make
        my work more permanent?" He decided on murals because of the permanence they have
        as opposed to expendable magazine illustrations. A large mural viewed every day
        has a lasting impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rozich, who lived in Akron, Columbus, and Chicago, settled in Alliance where he
        was contacted by Paul R. Schreckengost, the nephew of artist Viktor Schreckengost
        who passed away in January, to do a mural which was dedicated Oct. 3, at the beginning
        of the Sebring Harvest Home Festival. Rozich was the last of six artists interviewed
        for the position. His vision matched the Schreckengost vision, and he was hired
        on the spot. Rozich spent 300 hours on research and sketches, and 700 painting hours,
        to create the 1,800 square foot mural, which is 60 feet wide and 32 feet high.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mural depicts Schreckengost family members and prominent people of the Sebring
        community. Founded by George Sebring, the village is located in the Youngstown-Warren
        area of Mahoning County. A lot of research went into the people and places who created
        the history in Sebring. Schreckengost owns the corner of the block that the building
        sits on. He wanted the park around it to look like it goes on indefinitely. Rozich's
        work has a lot of dimension and was a perfect fit.

        With limited black and white photographs from the 1940s, Rozich used the heads from
        the photos while dressing himself in various costumes to model for the figures he
        put in the painting. He put that last brushstroke on the mural at 3 o'clock in the
        morning of Sept. 20. The end result combines Rozich's interpretation of Viktor and
        Paul Schreckengost's vision. The mural's dedication attracted more than 1000 people.
    </p>

        The next project for Rozich will be painting the ceilings of one of the few remaining
        turn of the century mansions built by F.A. Sebring. It is being restored for a Inn
        & Spa by Lynne Biery of Louisville, who purchased the mansion nearly 10 years ago.
    </p>

        Recently Rozich became engaged, and it is apparent that he is as romantic as he
        is artistic. He took his girlfriend to Disney World and proposed on a boat while
        fireworks blazed overhead. Of course she said "yes." Nicole Wallin, a teacher from
        Munroe Falls, is familiar with the time Rozich puts into his work. Rozich says that
        not many women would be as understanding of the hours he has to put in to complete
        a mural. But she totally supports his art and often comes to the worksite to keep
        him company while he paints. Their wedding date is set for July 25, 2009. Along
        with Wallin, Rozich's parents, Paul and Cindy, continue to support his art, as does
        his older brother, Trent, a landscaper.

        As Christmas approaches, Rozich is putting the final touches on his 16th Santa painting
        for his mother. She says that their home is like an art gallery with her son's Santa
        paintings and her collection of Santa figures, which she displays throughout the
        year. She is not allowed in her son's studio when he's working on the Santa painting,
        so it is always a surprise when he presents it to her on Christmas Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Along with his Santa Clauses and mural paintings, Rozich is a full-time graphic
        and web designer for RMR Development in Dover, Ohio. Like Norman Rockwell, Dirk
        Rozich enjoys making statements with illustration and creating fine art, but he
        seems most at home when he puts himself on the line between the two and tells a
        story.
